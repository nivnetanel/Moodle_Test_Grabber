# Moodle_Test_Grabber
This mini-project lets you download many copies of your moodles tests to pdf files using selenium

Please make sure that you've installed selenium, and chrome driver.
Make sure to read all the notes in the file - make sure that your moodle is in Hebrew, and also that your moodle actual button's titles are the same as the file

Enjoy 👏
