# Moodle_Test_Grabber
###This mini-project lets you download many copies of your moodles tests to pdf files using selenium

TO-DO:
Installed selenium, and download ChromeDriver.
Make sure to read all the notes in the file - make sure that your moodle is in Hebrew, and also that your moodle actual button's titles are the same as the file

Enjoy 👏
